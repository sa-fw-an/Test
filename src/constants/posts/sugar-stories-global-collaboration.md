# Connected Through Sugar: Our Rural-Urban Classroom Partnership

In an era where technology often divides us, we discovered how Sugar could build meaningful connections between children from vastly different backgrounds. This is the story of how our classrooms—one in rural Colombia and one in suburban Chicago—formed a year-long partnership that changed our students' perspectives on the world and each other.

## Two Different Worlds

Our schools couldn't be more different:

**Escuela San José (Santander, Colombia)**
- Small rural school with 75 students
- Limited technology resources (6 computers for the entire school)
- Intermittent internet access
- Many students from farming families
- Spanish as primary language

**Jefferson Middle School (Chicago, USA)**
- Large suburban school with 850 students
- 1:1 laptop program
- High-speed internet throughout campus
- Students from mostly professional families
- English as primary language

> "When we first proposed this partnership, many colleagues were skeptical. How could students with such different realities find common ground? What we discovered was that children's creativity transcends these differences when given the right tools."
> - Luis Ramirez, Teacher at Escuela San José

## Finding a Common Platform

The partnership began when Jennifer Thompson, a science teacher from Jefferson, visited Colombia as part of an educator exchange program. While visiting Escuela San José, she and Luis discovered they were both using Sugar in their classrooms.

"It was an 'aha' moment," Jennifer recalls. "Despite our different contexts, we were using the same platform. Sugar's emphasis on creation rather than consumption meant our students could collaborate meaningfully despite their different resources."

We identified three key advantages that made Sugar perfect for our cross-cultural partnership:

1. **Low technical requirements** - Sugar runs well even on San José's older computers
2. **Journal system** - Easy to share projects asynchronously when real-time connections weren't possible
3. **Visual interface** - Reduced language barriers through its iconic design
4. **Creation focus** - Enabled students to create and share their unique perspectives

## Our Collaboration Framework

We structured our partnership around four collaborative projects spread throughout the academic year:

| Project | Sugar Activities | Focus |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Community Mapping | Map, Paint, Record | Students documented important places in their communities |
| Local Traditions | Write, Record, Portfolio | Students shared cultural traditions and celebrations |
| Environmental Monitoring | Measure, Chart, Write | Students gathered and compared environmental data |
| Mathematical Art | TurtleArt, Portfolio | Students created art based on mathematical principles |

### Community Mapping Project

Our first collaboration revealed both the challenges and potential of our partnership. Students used Sugar's Map and Paint activities to create visual representations of their communities, adding audio recordings describing important locations.

**From the Colombian students**, Chicago students learned about:
- Life in a rural agricultural community
- The central importance of the weekly market
- How natural features like rivers shape daily life

**From the Chicago students**, Colombian students discovered:
- The complexity of urban transportation systems
- The diversity of a large American city
- The concept of shopping malls and movie theaters

The initial exchanges were somewhat hesitant, with students unsure how to relate to such different realities. But curiosity quickly overcame awkwardness.

## Overcoming Challenges

Our partnership faced several significant challenges:

### Technical Limitations
San José's internet connection was unreliable, making real-time video calls difficult. We adapted by:
- Creating an asynchronous sharing system using Sugar's Journal
- Scheduling video calls during optimal connectivity times
- Preparing backup offline activities when internet failed

### Language Barriers
With Spanish and English as our students' primary languages, communication could have been difficult. We addressed this through:
- Bilingual teacher facilitation
- Sugar's visual interface reducing reliance on text
- Basic language exchange components in our projects
- Paired students with complementary language skills

### Cultural Misunderstandings
Initial interactions revealed some stereotypes and misconceptions. We tackled these through:
- Guided reflection activities
- Direct addressing of stereotypes when they emerged
- Emphasis on individual stories rather than generalizations

> "When my students first saw the Chicago classroom with a laptop for every child, some felt embarrassed about our modest computer lab. But as the projects progressed, they realized that creativity isn't about having the most resources—it's about how you use what you have."
> - Luis Ramirez

## The Transformation

As the year progressed, we witnessed remarkable changes in both groups of students:

### For the Colombian Students
- Increased confidence in technology skills
- Improved English language abilities
- Greater awareness of global opportunities
- Pride in their unique cultural knowledge and perspectives

### For the Chicago Students
- More thoughtful consideration of resource consumption
- Appreciation for creativity with limited tools
- Interest in Spanish language and Latin American culture
- Recognition of community strengths beyond material wealth

## The Mathematical Art Finale

Our final project showcased how far the partnership had evolved. Using TurtleArt, students collaborated on mathematical art pieces that incorporated elements from both cultures. The Colombian students, despite having fewer resources, often demonstrated more creative uses of TurtleArt's features, impressing their Chicago counterparts.

The project culminated in a virtual art gallery where student pairs presented their collaborative creations, explaining both the mathematical concepts and cultural elements incorporated in their designs.

## Lasting Impact

Now in our second year of partnership, the impact extends beyond our original expectations:

1. **Student Communication** continues outside formal projects via email and social media
2. **Family Involvement** has increased, with parents joining calls and contributing to cultural exchange elements
3. **School Administrations** from both institutions now support expanding the model to other classrooms
4. **Teacher Professional Development** has evolved as we share our experience with colleagues

Most importantly, students from both schools have developed a more nuanced understanding of each other's worlds—recognizing both challenges and strengths in both contexts.

As Maria, a student from San José, reflected: "Before, I thought kids in the United States had everything perfect. Now I see they have different problems, and sometimes they don't have some good things we have, like being close to nature and having family nearby all the time."

And from Jackson in Chicago: "I used to think I needed the newest technology to do cool stuff. The kids in Colombia showed me that imagination matters more than having the latest gear."

## Conclusion

Through Sugar, our students discovered that meaningful collaboration doesn't require identical resources or circumstances—it requires creativity, curiosity, and tools that enable expression. In a world increasingly divided by technology access, Sugar has helped our students build bridges rather than walls.

The partnership continues to evolve, with new projects and new students joining each year. What began as an experimental connection between two classrooms has become a sustainable model for global education that honors both the universal nature of childhood curiosity and the unique perspectives that different contexts provide.
