# Summer Code Sprint 2025: Advancing Sugar's Core

Calling all developers! Sugar Labs is hosting our annual **Summer Code Sprint** from July 10-24, 2025. This two-week virtual development event focuses on enhancing Sugar's core functionality, fixing bugs, and implementing new features that will benefit the entire Sugar ecosystem.

## About the Summer Code Sprint

Unlike our hackathon which focuses on creating new activities, the Summer Code Sprint is dedicated to improving Sugar's underlying architecture and core components. This is a perfect opportunity for experienced developers to make significant contributions to the Sugar platform.

### Sprint Goals

For the 2025 Summer Code Sprint, we've identified these priority areas:

1. **Performance Optimization** - Improving Sugar's speed and responsiveness
2. **UI/UX Enhancements** - Refining the user interface while maintaining Sugar's child-friendly design
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility** - Ensuring seamless operation across different operating systems
4. **Documentation Improvements** - Updating and expanding our technical documentation
5. **Testing Infrastructure** - Strengthening our testing framework

## How to Participate

The Sprint is open to developers of all skill levels, though familiarity with Sugar's architecture is helpful. To join:

1. Sign up on our [Sprint registration page](https://sugarlabs.org/sprint2025)
2. Join our developer mailing list and the #summer-sprint channel on Slack
3. Review the [project task board](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/projects)
4. Set up your development environment before July 10

### Sprint Schedule

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| July 10 | Sprint Kickoff Meeting (Virtual) |
| July 12 | First Check-in & Progress Report |
| July 17 | Mid-Sprint Review |

## Technical Requirements

Participants should have:

* A GitHub account
* Development environment for Sugar (see our [setup guide](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/blob/master/docs/development.md))
* Familiarity with Python (primary language for Sugar development)
* Basic understanding of GTK (for UI components)

## Mentorship Opportunities

New to Sugar development? We'll pair you with experienced Sugar developers who can guide you through your first contributions. Mentors will be available throughout the sprint to provide assistance and code reviews.

> "The Summer Code Sprint is where we tackle the challenging but crucial work of strengthening Sugar's foundation. These improvements might be less visible than new activities, but they're essential for Sugar's stability and growth."

### Recognition and Rewards

All contributors will be recognized on our website and in the Sugar release notes. Top contributors will receive:

* Limited edition Sugar Labs developer merchandise
* Recognition certificates
* Opportunity to present their work at the next Sugar Labs Conference
* Priority consideration for future paid development contracts

## Post-Sprint Integration

Code developed during the Sprint will be reviewed, tested, and incorporated into the next Sugar release. Contributors are encouraged to remain involved with the integration process even after the formal Sprint ends.
