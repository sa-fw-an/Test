# Contributor Interview: Priya Sharma - From User to Core Developer

**Priya Sharma** first encountered Sugar as a mathematics teacher in Bangalore, India. Today, she's one of Sugar Labs' most active core developers, having contributed over 200 pull requests to our GitHub repositories. Her journey from user to developer exemplifies the power of our open-source community and its commitment to educational equality.

## From Classroom to Code

"I never imagined I would become a software developer," Priya admits with a smile during our video interview. "My background was in mathematics education, not computer science."

Priya's journey with Sugar began in 2020 when her school received a shipment of computers with Sugar pre-installed. Initially intimidated by the platform, she soon found herself exploring its capabilities and thinking of improvements.

### First Contributions

"What changed everything was discovering a small bug in the Calculate Activity," Priya recalls. "The square root function wasn't working properly for certain values. Instead of just reporting it, I decided to try fixing it myself."

Despite having minimal coding experience, Priya followed the Sugar Labs contributor guidelines and submitted her first patch:

1. She learned how to use Git and GitHub
2. She studied enough Python to understand the Calculate Activity code
3. She found the bug in the code and created a simple fix
4. She submitted her first pull request

> "I still remember the feeling when my first pull request was merged. It was just a two-line fix, but seeing my code become part of Sugar was incredibly empowering. I was hooked!"

## Growing as a Developer

Priya's development journey accelerated after that first contribution:

| Year | Development Milestones |
|------|------------------------|
| 2020 | First bug fix to Calculate Activity |
| 2021 | Improved localization for Hindi language |
| 2022 | Created new Math visualization tools |
| 2023 | Became maintainer of Calculate Activity |
| 2024 | Joined Core Development Team |

"Learning to code was challenging, especially while teaching full-time," Priya explains. "But the Sugar Labs community was incredibly supportive. Whenever I got stuck, there was always someone willing to mentor me through difficult concepts."

## Notable Contributions

Today, Priya's contributions to Sugar include:

- **Calculate Activity Overhaul** - Added advanced functions, improved UI, and enhanced accessibility
- **Hindi Localization** - Significantly improved Hindi language support across Sugar
- **Math Visualization Library** - Created reusable components for displaying mathematical concepts
- **Performance Optimization** - Reduced memory usage across several core activities
- **Documentation** - Wrote comprehensive developer guides for new contributors

### The Teacher's Perspective

What makes Priya's contributions particularly valuable is her perspective as an educator:

"When I work on Sugar code, I'm always thinking as a teacher first. I ask myself: How will this help children learn? Is this interface intuitive? Will this feature work in a classroom with 30 students and limited technical support?"

This educator's viewpoint has influenced Sugar's development in subtle but important ways, ensuring the platform remains firmly grounded in pedagogical principles.

## Advice for New Contributors

Based on her experience, Priya offers these tips for new Sugar Labs contributors:

1. **Start small** - "Fix a simple bug or improve documentation before tackling large features."
2. **Ask questions** - "Our community values questions. No one expects you to know everything."
3. **Think like a user** - "Always keep in mind the teachers and children who will use your code."
4. **Be patient** - "Learning both coding and educational design takes time."
5. **Attend developer meetings** - "Regular interaction with the community accelerates learning."

> "Contributing to Sugar has made me a better teacher and a better technologist. I understand more deeply how children learn, and how technology can support that learning."

## The Future

Looking ahead, Priya has ambitious goals for Sugar:

"I'm currently working on a machine learning module that can help activities adapt to each child's learning pace. I'm also passionate about making Sugar more accessible for students with disabilities."

When asked what motivates her to volunteer so many hours to Sugar Labs, Priya's answer is simple:

"Education transformed my life. By helping make Sugar better, I'm extending that opportunity to children around the world, especially those without access to expensive educational resources. What could be more meaningful than that?"
